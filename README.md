## Search Nearest Ambulance:

*Users can search for the nearest available ambulance by providing their current location's address.*
*The application uses the Geopy library to convert the user's address into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).*
*It then calculates the distance to find the nearest ambulance driver from the user's location.*
*The system displays information about the nearest ambulance driver, including their name, driver ID, phone number, associated hospital, and hospital location.*
